"Many times it is required to count the occurrence of each word in a text file!
To achieve so, we make use of a dictionary object that stores the word as the key
and its count as the corresponding value."
We iterate through each word in the file and add it to the dictionary with a count of #1.
If the word is already present in the dictionary we increment its count by $1.
